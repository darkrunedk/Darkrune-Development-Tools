# Darkrune-Development-Tools

A small tool to help with stuff related to .NET development.

## What can it help with?

For now the tool can help with quickly identifying the things needed for setting up devops variables based on either a appsettings.json (.NET Core) file or a web.config file (.NET framework).
It will create a list with all identified key/value pairs and copy buttons for each key/value.
